# Frontend Project Structure

## Overview

This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure and organization of our frontend application.

## Folder Structure

Below is the representation of the main file structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚Â Â  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ common
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ utils
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ constants.js
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
```

- `public`: This directory contains the main `index.html` file.

The structure of our `src` directory is as follows:

- `assets`: This directory is used to store static files such as images and markdowns used in the app.

- `components`: This directory contains folders like `common`, `footer`, `header`, `herosection`, etc., where components related to a certain page or section are grouped together.
    - `common`: This subdirectory inside the `components` directory is used for storing reusable components like `input`, `divider`, `accordion`, `modal`, etc.

- `hooks`: This directory contains custom React hooks.

- `pages`: This directory contains components that represent different pages of the application. The routing to these pages is handled by React Router.

- `utils`: This directory contains utility functions and helper functions that are used across multiple components or pages in the application.

- `constants.js`: This file contains constant values that are used throughout the application. These could be URLs for API endpoints, content of the app, etc.

- `App.js`: This file serves as the main entry point for the applicationâ€™s components, hooks, and pages. It also manages user navigation within the application.

- `index.css`: This is the main CSS file. It defines global styles and CSS variables.

- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. It imports the App component and enables routing.
